Revision history for Perl extension App::Sqitch

0.12
     - Added `--local` option to `sqitch config`.
     - Renamed `project_file()` to `--local_file()` in App::Sqitch::Config.
     - `sqitch init` now writes engine config settings with default values to
       the configuration file. This makes it easier for folks to get started
       editing it.

     - Started sketching out the engine interface, with preliminary PostgreSQL

     - Fixed test failures on different verions of Moose.
     - Fixed test failure on Perl 5.12.
