sqitch-bundle - Bundle a Sqitch project for distribution

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [options] bundle project
  sqitch [options] bundle --dest-dir widgets-1.0.0
  sqitch [options] bundle pg mysql

=head1 Description

This command bundles up a sqitch project for distribution. At its simplest, it
copies the project configuration file, plan files, and all of the change
scripts to a directory. This directory can then be packaged up for
distribution (as a tarball, RPM, etc.).

By default, all project plans known to the Sqitch configuration will be
bundled, along with their scripts. This is useful for packaging up a project
for multiple database engines. If, however, you'd like to limit a bundle to
just a subset of plans, identify the plans on the command-line by passing one
or more of the following arguments:

=over

=item * Engine names

=item * Target names

=item * Plan file names

=back

You can also pass the core C<--engine> option to limit the bundle to the plan
for a single engine.

The bundle command also allows you to limit bundled changes to a subset of
those in a plan. When bundling a single plan, use the C<--from> and/or C<--to>
options to do the limiting. When using multiple plans, specify the changes
after each target argument. In either case, the changes can be specified in
any way documented on L<sqitchchanges>. See L</Examples> for examples.

=head1 Options

=over

=item C<--dest-dir>

The name of the directory in which to bundle the project. The configuration
file will be created in this directory, and all top, deploy, revert, and
verify directories will be created relative to it. Defaults to F<bundle>.

=item C<--from>

The change from which to start bundling. If you need to bundle up only a subset
of a plan, specify a change (using a supported L<change specification|sqitchchanges>
from which to start the bundling via this option. This option is probably only
useful when bundling a single plan.

=item C<--to>

The change to which to end bundling. If you need to bundle up only a subset
of a plan, specify a change (using a supported L<change specification|sqitchchanges>
that should be the last change to be included in the bundle. This option is
probably only useful when bundling a single plan.

=over

=item C<bundle.dest_dir>

The name of the directory in which to bundle the project.

=head1 Examples

Bundle a Sqitch project into F<BUILDROOT/MyProj>:

  sqitch bundle --dest-dir BUILDROOT/MyProj

Bundle a project including changes C<adduser> through C<@v1.0>:

  sqitch bundle --from adduser --to @v1.0

Bundle a the C<pg> engine plans with changes C<adduser> through C<@v1.0>, and
the C<sqlite> engine with changes from the start of the plan up to C<widgets>:

  sqitch bundle pg adduser @v1.0 sqlite @ROOT wigets

Bundle just the files necessary to execute the plan for the C<pg> engine:

  sqitch bundle pg

Bundle the files necessary for two plan files:

  sqitch bundle sqlite/sqitch.plan mysql/sqitch.plan

Part of the L<sqitch> suite.
