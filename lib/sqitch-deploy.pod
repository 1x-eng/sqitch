=head1 Name

sqitch-deploy - Deploy changes to a database

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [options] deploy
  sqitch [options] deploy <target>
  sqitch [options] deploy --to <target>

=head1 Description

Deploy changes to the database. Changes will begin from the current deployment
state. They will run to the latest step, unless a target is specified, either
via C<--to> or with no option flag, in which case changes will be deployed
up-to and including that target.

If the database it up-to-date or already deployed to the specified target, no
changes will be made. If the target appears earlier in the plan than the
currently-deployed state, an error will be returned, along with a suggestion
to instead use L<sqitch-revert>.

=head1 Specifying Targets

A C<< <target> >> option typically, but not necessarily, names a target object.

=over

=item C<step>, e.g, C<users_table>

A step name.

=item C<< @<tag> >>, e.g, C<@beta>

A tag name.

=begin comment

These are not yet implemented.

=item C<HEAD>

Special symbolic name for the last step in the plan. Typically omitted.

=item C<< <target>^ >>, e.g., C<HEAD^^>, C<users_table^3>, C<@beta^2>

A suffix C<^> to a symbolic or actual name means the step I<prior> to that
target. Multiple C<^>s indicate multiple prior steps. These can also be
written as C<< ^<n> >>, where C<< <n> >> represents the number of steps to go
back.

=item C<< <target>+ >>, e.g., C<HEAD+>, C<foo++>, C<@bar+4>

A suffix C<+> to a symbolic or actual target name that means the step I<after>
that target. Multiple C<+>s indicate multiple prior steps. These can also be
written as C<< +<n> >>, where C<< <n> >> represents the number of steps to go
forward.
