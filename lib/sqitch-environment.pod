sqitch-environment - Environment variables recognized by Sqitch

=head1 Description

Sqitch supports a number of environment variables that affect its
functionality. This document lists them all, along with brief descriptions of
their purposes and pointers to relevant documentation.

=over

=item C<SQITCH_CONFIG>

Path to the project configuration file. Overrides the default, which is
F<./sqitch.conf>. See L<sqitch-config> for details.

=item C<SQITCH_USER_CONFIG>

Path to the user's configuration file. Overrides the default, which is
F<./.sqitch/sqitch.conf>. See L<sqitch-config> for details.

=item C<SQITCH_SYSTEM_CONFIG>

Path to the system's configuration file. Overrides the default, which is a
file named C<sqitch.conf> in the directory identified by C<sqitch --etc>. See
L<sqitch-config> for details.

=item C<SQITCH_USERNAME>

Username to use when connecting to a database, for those database engines that
support authentication. Overrides values stored in a target URI or the
configuration file. See L<sqitch-passwords> for details.

=item C<SQITCH_PASSWORD>

Password to use when connecting to a database, for those database engines that
support authentication. Overrides values stored in a target URI or the
configuration file. See L<sqitch-passwords> for details.

=item C<SQITCH_FULLNAME>

Full name of the current user. Used to identify the user adding a change to a
plan file or deploying a change. Supersedes the <user.name> L<sqitch-config>
variable.

=item C<SQITCH_EMAIL>

Email address of the current user. Used to identify the user adding a change to
a plan file or deploying a change. Supersedes the C<user.email> L<sqitch-config>
variable.

=item C<SQITCH_ORIG_SYSUSER>

Username from the original system. Intended for use by scripts that run Sqitch
from another host, where the originating host username should be passed to the
execution host, such as
L<this Docker script|https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh>.

=item C<SQITCH_ORIG_FULLNAME>

Full name of the original system user. Intended for use by scripts that run
Sqitch from another host, where the originating host user's identity should be
passed to the execution host, such as
L<this Docker script|https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh>.
This value will be used only when neither the C<$SQITCH_FULLNAME> nor the
C<user.name> L<sqitch-config> variable is set.

=item C<SQITCH_ORIG_EMAIL>

Email address of the original user. Intended for use by scripts that run
Sqitch on a separate host, where the originating host user's identity should
be passed to the execution host, such as
L<this Docker script|https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh>.
This value will be used only when neither the C<$SQITCH_EMAIL> nor the
C<user.email> L<sqitch-config> variable is set.

=item C<SQITCH_EDITOR>

The editor that Sqitch will launch when the user needs to edit some text (a
change note, for example). If unset, the C<core.editor> configuration variable
will be used. If it's not set, C<$VISUAL> or C<$EDITOR> will be consulted (in
that order).  Finally, if none of these are set, Sqitch will invoke
C<notepad.exe> on Windows and C<vi> elsewhere.

=item C<SQITCH_PAGER>

The pager program that Sqitch will use when a command (like C<sqitch log>)
produces multi-page output. If unset, the C<core.pager> configuration
variable will be used. If this is also not set, the C<PAGER> environment
variable will be used. Finally, if none of these are set, Sqitch will attempt
to find and use one of the commonly used pager programs like C<less> and
C<more>.
